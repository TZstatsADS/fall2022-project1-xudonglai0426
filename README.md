### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) project this semester. 

Term: Fall 2022

+ Projec title: How different schools of philosophy affect writing format?
+ This project is conducted by [Donglai Xu]

+ Project summary: [a short summary] Intuitively, the idea of different schools will definitely be different from each other, therefore the best way to identify the school of a document is to look at their thesis or the author. However, is this the only way to determine it? I don't think so. The school of a philosophy document can also be dertemined by the format. According to the level of average number of word per sentences, total number of word and average number of sentences for each school, we can classifiy all of the schools into three categories: small, medium and large. With this classification, if the values of these three features of one document with unknown class is given, we are able to determine which class it belongs to.
